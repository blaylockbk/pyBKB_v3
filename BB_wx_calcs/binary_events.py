    "How well did the forecast "yes" events correspond to the observed "yes"

        Perfect Score = 1

    The total number of correct event forecasts (hits) divided by the total
    number of event forecasts plus the number of misses. Strongly dependent
    on the base rate because it is not affected by the number of non-event
    forecasts that are not observed (correct rejections).

    Measures the fraction of observed and/or forecast events that were
    correctly predicted. It can be thought of as the accuracy when correct
    negatives have been removed from consideration, that is, TS is only
    concerned with forecasts that count. Sensitive to hits, penalizes both
    misses and false alarms. Does not distinguish source of forecast error.
    Depends on climatological frequency of events (poorer scores for rarer
    events) since some hits can occur purely due to random chance.

def gilbert_skill_score(a, b, c, d):
    """
    Also known as the Equitable Threat Score (ETS).
    Widely used for the verification of deterministic forecasts of rare events
    such as precipitation above a large threshold. However, the score is not
    "equitable."
    "How well did the forecast "yes" events correspond to the observed "yes"
    events (accounting for hits due to chance)?"
        Range: [-1/3, 1]; Zero is no skill; Perfect Score = 1

    Measures the fraction of observed and/or forecast events that were
    correctly predicted, adjusted for hits associated with random chance
    (for example, it is easier to correctly forecast rain occurrence in a wet
    climate than in a dry climate). The ETS is often used in the verification
    of rainfall in NWP models because its "equitability" allows scores to be
    compared more fairly across different regimes. Sensitive to hits. Because
    it penalizes both misses and false alarms in the same way, it does not
    distinguish the source of forecast error.

    `a_r` (a random) is the number of hits expected a forecasts independent
    of observations (pure chance). Since (n) is in the denominator, GSS depends
    explicitly on the number of correct rejections (d). In other words, `a_r`
    is the expected (a) for a random forecast with the same forecast rate (r)
    and base rate (s).
    """

    Also known as the Hanssen and Kuipers discriminant or True Skill Statistic.
    Ratio of hits to total number of events observed minus the ratio of false
    alarms to total number of non-events observed (i.e. PSS = H-F).
    "How well did the forecast separate the "yes" events from the "no" events?"
        Range [-1,1]; Perfect Score = 1

    Uses all elements in contingency table. Does not depend on climatological
    event frequency. The expression is identical to PSS = POD - POFD, but the
    Peirce Skill score can also be interpreted as
            (accuracy for events) + (accuracy for non-events) - 1
    For rare events, PSS is unduly weighted toward the first term (same as
    POD), so this score may be more useful for more frequent events.
