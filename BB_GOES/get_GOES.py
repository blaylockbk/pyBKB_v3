"""
Get GOES GLM or ABI data from Horel-Group7

NOTE: For reference, we expect 180 GLM files per hour (file every 20 seconds)
      and 12 ABI files per hour (CONUS file every 5 minutes with ~2.5 minutes 
      for each scan cycle).
      Thus, we expect 15 GLM data files for a 5 minute ABI window.

Approximate Timeline of 5 minutes of ABI and GLM data collection:
    ABI scan    (start)[----------------|_____________](end)
    GLM scan    (start)[-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.](end)

    Where:
        - (dash) is 10 seconds of data collection
        _ (underscore) is 10 seconds of no data collection
        . (period) is an additional 10 second interval of GLM data collection.
